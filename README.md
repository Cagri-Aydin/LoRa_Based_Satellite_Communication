# LoRa_Based_Satellite_Communication

# Transmitting Data Over Satellites via LoRa  (Still In Development)

This project simulates an end-to-end system that consists of two main components: a **satellite (bridge node)** and a **central hub (ground station)**. In this simulation, environmental data collected by sensor nodes (whose code is not part of this project) is transmitted via LoRa to the satellite. The satellite then aggregates and forwards the data to the central hub, where the data is logged and analyzed. Additionally, the central hub is capable of sending commands to control the satelliteâ€™s movements (for example rotating the satellite, opening and closing the solar panels).

## Features

- **LoRa-Based Communication:** The satellite receives data via LoRa from remote sensor nodes.
- **Data Aggregation and Forwarding:** The satellite collects the incoming data and relays it to the central hub through a secondary communication channel (such as WiFi/MQTT).
- **Movement Control:** The central hub can send commands to the satellite to control its movement (for instance, adjusting a servo motor).
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** The central hub logs and visualizes incoming data in real time, allowing for immediate analysis and feedback.

## System Architecture

The project is composed of two primary components:

1. **Satellite (Bridge Node):**  
   - Acts as the intermediary between remote sensor nodes and the central hub.
   - Receives sensor data via LoRa and forwards it to the central hub.
   - Receives control commands from the central hub to adjust its movement. (LoRA)

2. **Central Hub (Ground Station):**  
   - Collects and logs data received from the satellite.
   - Analyzes the incoming data and displays it in real time.
   - Sends control commands to the satellite to manage its movement.

> **Note:** Sensor node code is not part of this project; it is assumed that sensor nodes are already deployed and transmitting data to the satellite via LoRa.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- **Satellite (Bridge Node):**
  - An ESP32-based or similar microcontroller with an integrated LoRa module.

- **Central Hub (Ground Station):**
  - A PC.
  
*Note:* Sensor node hardware is not included in this project scope.

### Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for developing and uploading firmware to the satellite.

## Installation

### Hardware Connections

1. **Satellite (Bridge Node):**  
   - Will be uploaded soon.

2. **Central Hub (Ground Station):**  
   - Will be uploaded soon.

### Software Setup

1. **Satellite (Bridge Node):**  
   - Flash the firmware that handles receiving data via LoRa and forwarding it to the central hub via WiFi/MQTT.
   - The firmware also includes functionality to process incoming control commands (such as movement commands) from the central hub.
   
2. **Central Hub (Ground Station):**  
   - Set up an MQTT client (for example, using Python with paho-mqtt) to subscribe to the data topic from the satellite.
   - Configure the client to log and display incoming data.
   - Implement a mechanism for sending control commands (e.g., "MOVE:90") to the satellite.

## Usage Scenario

1. **Data Reception:**  
   - The satellite continuously listens for LoRa transmissions from remote sensor nodes. When sensor data is received, it is immediately processed and forwarded to the central hub.

2. **Data Forwarding and Logging:**  
   - The central hub receives the data from the satellite, logs it, and displays it in real time for analysis.
   
3. **Control Commands:**  
   - The user can send movement commands from the central hub (for example, adjusting the angle of a servo motor on the satellite). The satellite receives these commands and actuates the corresponding hardware accordingly.

## Additional Notes

- **Project Simulation:** This project simulates a satellite communication system. For real-world satellite communication and movement control, additional hardware, extensive testing, and fine-tuning are required.
- **LoRa Parameters:** The LoRa settings (frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, etc.) should be determined experimentally and must comply with regional legal regulations.
- **Communication Protocols:** While this project uses LoRa for the satellite-to-central hub link, other protocols can be implemented as needed.
- **Expandability:** The system can be extended by adding more sensor nodes, implementing advanced data analytics, or integrating with cloud-based IoT platforms.
